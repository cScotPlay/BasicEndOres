[Basic End Ores](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/basic-end-ores) Basic End Ores spawn vanilla and modded ores in the End.  Simply put, this mod extends the ability for the player to mine ores and gems in the End giving the End new life and meaning.  Modded ores have been added to the mod for function in other mods.  Spawn rates for End Ores are set equal to or higher than their vanilla counterparts to make mining the End worthwhile.  Texturing is not overdone making the player pay attention to the surrounding areas to identify End Ores.
